1. Run the commands sort, wc and uniq on the commands.js file.
Explain how they work and what the output was.

Answer:
sort : output the contents of the file order by alphabet based on each indented bloc.

wc : prints the number of lines, words and characters inside of the file.
The result is 46 lines, 121 words and 1205 characters.

uniq : returns the file contents removing duplicated lines.


2. Using the pipe (|) connect at least two commands and run it on commands.js.
Explain what the output was and why the specific data was outputted.

Answer:
INPUT: cat commands.js | wc 
OUTPUT: 43     121    1202

INPUT: uniq commands.js | wc
OUTPUT: 43     121    1202

cat and uniq produces the same output when piped with wc.
This means there is no duplication in the commands.js file.

function reverseWord(word){
	var stack = [];
	for(let i=0; word.length > i; i++){
		stack.push(word[i]);
	}

	var reversed = '';
	while(stack.length > 0){
		var letter = stack.pop();
		reversed += letter;
	}
return reversed;
}


function reverse(phrase){
    var words = phrase.split(' ');
    var allPhrases = '';
    words.forEach(function(word){
        var reversedWord = reverseWord(word);
        console.log(reversedWord);
		allPhrases = allPhrases + ' ' + reversedWord;
    });
return allPhrases;
 }
